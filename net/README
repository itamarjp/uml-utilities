Q. What is UM-Eth-Net?
A. It is an Ethernet driver which works only with User-Mode Linux (UML).  It
   allows a UML to connect to other UMLs via a virtual network.  It also allows
   a UML to act as a host on your real world Ethernet subnet or use your
   native machine as a router.

Q. How do I add it to a UML Kernel?
A. Say yes to the Network Device option for "Virtual Ethernet driver"

   Recompile your kernel and your set to go.  You'll see:

User-mode Linux network interface 0.010 (eth0)
User-mode Linux network interface 0.010 (eth1)
User-mode Linux network interface 0.010 (eth2)
User-mode Linux network interface 0.010 (eth3)

   in the boot up sequence if it worked.

Q. How do I use it?
A. Fire up two UM-Eth-Net enabled kernels.
   Fire up um_eth_serv (tools/net/)
   Inside of each UML configure eth0 with an
   IP addresses (make sure the IP addresses are in the same subnet)

ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

   Now try and ping the other hosts.  Your notice some weird timing
   but the packets do make it :-)

Q. How do I make it act as a host on my REAL network?
A. When you fire up um_eth_serv use the following command line as root:

um_eth_serv eth0 100

   This make the physical port eth0 be a member of UM-Eth-Net network 100
   (100 is the default network number)

Q. How do I get my native machine on the network?
A. You need to have compiled your native kernel with:

Under "Code maturity level options":
 [*] Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers 

Under "Networking options":
 [*] Kernel/User netlink socket
 [*]   Routing messages
 <*>   Netlink device emulation

(for 2.2.x kernels)
Under "Network Device support":
 <*> Ethertap network tap (EXPERIMENTAL)

(for 2.4.x kernels)
Under "Network Device support":
 <*>  "Universal TUN/TAP device driver support:"

   Then execute:

um_eth_serv tap0 100

   Configure your native machine:

ifconfig tap0 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0

   Configure your UML.

Q. How do I make more then one network?
A. You'll have to get the program uml_set into a UML for this to work.
   Once you have it there up can modify what network a UM-Eth-Net interface
   is on with this command line (while in the UML):

um_eth_tool eth0 101

   This make UM-Eth-Net interface eth0 a member of network 101.  Any other
   UM-Eth-Net interface on any other UML in network 101 can now talk to
   each other.

Q. It doesn't work for me, what do I do?
A. E-mail me at jleu@mindspring.com and I'll see if I can help.
