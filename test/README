This directory contains the UML package, in UML.pm, and a little demo
in boot.pl.  Read the pod at the end of UML.pm to see what the UML
methods and their arguments are.

You can run the demo with "perl -I . boot.pl".  You will need to
change the kernel command line in boot.pl, and maybe pass in values
for the login and password prompts, the login account name and
password, and the shell prompt to UML::new().

boot.pl will boot up the virtual machine, run "ls -al", and halt.
