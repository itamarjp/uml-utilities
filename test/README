This directory contains the UML package, in UML.pm, a test harness in
tsuite.pl, and some tests in t.  Read the pod at the end of UML.pm to
see what the UML methods and their arguments are.

You can run the suite with "perl -I . tsuite.pl".  You will need to
change the kernel command line in tsuite.pl, and maybe pass in values
for the login and password prompts, the login account name and
password, and the shell prompt to UML::new().

It will boot up a virtual machine and run the tests, logging the
machine output in "test.log" and the test output in t/*.log.
